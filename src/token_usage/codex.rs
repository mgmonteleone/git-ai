//! Codex rollout transcript usage extraction.
//!
//! Ported from ccusage's Codex adapter (rust/adapters/codex/src/parser.rs in
//! <https://github.com/ccusage/ccusage>, MIT License, Copyright (c) 2025
//! @ryoppippi), adapted to git-ai's incremental line-oriented streaming with
//! persisted parser state.
//!
//! Deviations from ccusage:
//! - Session rollout format only (`event_msg`/`token_count`, `turn_context`,
//!   `session_meta`); the headless `codex exec` log format is not tracked by
//!   git-ai's streams and is not parsed.
//! - The service tier is resolved per entry at extraction time (recorded
//!   `thread_settings_applied` tier, else the injected config fallback, else
//!   standard) and stored on the entry; ccusage's auto mode instead applies
//!   the config in force at *report* time to unmarked usage, retroactively
//!   repricing history when `~/.codex/config.toml` changes.
//! - No `codex-auto-review` release-date fallback table; model ids price
//!   through git-ai's catalog.
//! - Fork replay matches ccusage: a forked session's leading usage is
//!   matched against the parent log's pre-fork usage prefix and skipped. The
//!   whole-file read happens in the worker (the extractor can't read other
//!   files incrementally): a fork parks in `AwaitingParent` until the worker
//!   answers with the prefix, and the unmatched remainder persists in the
//!   extractor state so the parent is never rescanned across passes or
//!   restarts. A parent that cannot be resolved falls back — like ccusage
//!   with an unavailable parent log — to the "rewritten burst" heuristic
//!   (leading usage events spaced <= 1s apart are replayed history), and is
//!   not retried.
//! - Numeric token fields accept ccusage's aliases and string-encoded
//!   numbers, but a line whose payload/info has an unexpected *shape* (e.g. a
//!   scalar where an object belongs) is skipped whole, where ccusage's lossy
//!   deserializers would still process it. Timestamp parsing is slightly
//!   more lenient than ccusage's fixed-width RFC3339 forms.
//! - Cost: no `codex-auto-review` model mapping (that model prices at $0
//!   unless the catalog learns it); see `cost.rs` for the shared pricing
//!   rules and deviations.
