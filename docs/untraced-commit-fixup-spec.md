# Untraced Commit Fixup Spec

Status: authoritative spec for how the git-ai daemon attributes commits it never
saw through trace2. Companion docs:

- `docs/daemon-trace2-ingestion-spec.md` — the traced path this is a fallback to.
- `docs/rewrite-ops-spec.md` — why rewrites are out of scope here.

## The problem

Attribution runs in the daemon, driven by trace2. Three situations produce
commits that never reach it:

- the daemon was off (upgrade, crash, reboot);
- the git client emits no trace2 (JGit / IntelliJ, libgit2-based tools);
- trace2 is emitted but cannot reach the daemon socket (sandboxes; the daemon
  also refuses to start inside Cursor/Claude/Codex sandboxes).

Those commits got no authorship note and no `Committed` telemetry, even when
working logs existed for them. Since the checkpoint CLI exits quietly when the
daemon is unreachable, daemon-off periods usually have no working logs either;
attribution recovery (`src/authorship/attribution_recovery.rs`) is then the
main evidence.

## Ownership model

The per-worktree `HEAD` reflog is written only for operations performed in
that worktree, with a tool-generated message:

| reflog message prefix | meaning | fixup |
|---|---|---|
| `commit:`, `commit (initial):`, `commit (merge):` | a new commit created here | candidate |
| `commit (amend):` | rewrite | skip |
| `rebase*`, `pull*`, `cherry-pick:`, `revert:`, `merge *:`, `reset:`, `checkout:`, `am:`, anything else | rewrite, replay, or remote content | skip |

A candidate must be **corroborated by the branch reflog**: the identical
`old new … message` record in `<common_dir>/logs/refs/heads/<branch>`. Git writes
both records for a commit on a checked-out branch and only `HEAD`'s for a
detached commit, including a manual `git commit` inside a stopped rebase. This
excludes rebase replays structurally; pulled commits never produce `commit:`
records at all. Detached-HEAD commits are skipped (fail closed).

**Exclusive ownership.** A reflog record has exactly one owner. Records a
traced command consumed are skipped by the fixup; records the fixup claims are
consumed the same way, so a late trace2 command cannot claim them again. All
decisions happen inside the family actor, in sequence
(`RefCursor::claim_untraced_commits`).

**One cursor owner.** The actor keeps a per-worktree fixup cursor (byte offset
plus the anchoring record), separate from the traced in-order cursor so that
settling past records nobody owns (a rebase still open in an editor) never
hides them from the command that eventually completes. The repo-family store
persists a snapshot of it and seeds a cold actor.

## No backfill

The cursor starts at the actor's own fixup position, else at the persisted
seed from an earlier daemon lifetime, else at the traced cursor's observation
point (its in-order offset, or the newest record it consumed while cold), else
at the reflog end. A cursor that no longer matches the reflog (offset beyond
EOF, anchor mismatch after `reflog expire`) is re-seeded at the end. Only
records appended after a valid cursor are ever considered. "Known repo" means:
a cursor from before the missed commit exists.

Ownership is decided from what traced commands actually consumed: records
still in the consumed set, and byte ranges the traced cursor compacted or
jumped over while consuming. The traced in-order offset alone is not
ownership — a cold seed from an ingress capture deliberately jumps over prior
untraced history, which is exactly what the fixup exists to claim.

## Non-interference invariants

1. Nothing is added to trace ingestion, checkpoint admission, or the
   normalizer. The worker reads two counters and skips its tick while trace
   frames are still queued, and leaves a family alone while one of its git
   commands is still running (an open mutating trace root), so a scan never
   sits fenced at the head of that family's sequencer.
2. A fixup pass is a family sequencer entry appended at the current time: the
   causal fence holds it behind older open roots, and the per-family exec lock
   serializes it with commands and checkpoints.
3. Records younger than `GIT_AI_DAEMON_UNTRACED_FIXUP_MIN_AGE_MS` (5 s) are left
   for a later pass.
4. The fixup never writes the `HEAD` reflog; post-commit writes notes and
   working logs exactly as the traced path does.
5. An unchanged reflog costs one `stat` per worktree per tick. No git spawns
   without a candidate. A pass attributes at most 10 commits and checks their
   notes in one batch; a tick schedules at most 32 worktrees.
6. Fail closed: invalid cursor, missing reflog, bare repository, detached HEAD,
   unknown message shape — skip and settle, never guess.

## What runs

- **Claim** (`src/daemon/ref_cursor.rs`, `src/daemon/family_actor.rs`): claimed
  records become synthetic `git commit` commands with exact `ref_changes`
  (HEAD and branch), reduced through the normal reducer so the analyzers emit
  `CommitCreated` and `FamilyState` stays current.
- **Pass** (`src/daemon.rs`, `FamilySequencerEntry::UntracedCommitScan`): the
  normal side-effect dispatch runs for each claimed commit — working logs are
  consumed and carried forward, recovery fills holes, the note is written, and
  the `Committed` metric carries `commit_source = untraced_fixup` (position 18;
  null for traced commits). Commits that already have a note are skipped.
  Synthetic commits are never `sync_tracked` in the test completion log.
- **Store** (`src/daemon/repo_family_store.rs`): families and per-worktree
  cursors, written only by the fixup. Families whose common dir is missing for
  7 days, unseen for 90 days, or beyond the 1000 most recent are pruned.
- **Worker** (`src/daemon/untraced_commit_fixup.rs`): every
  `GIT_AI_DAEMON_UNTRACED_FIXUP_INTERVAL_MS` (10 s; first tick at startup),
  gated by the `untraced_commit_fixup` feature flag. `fixup.scan` on the control
  socket runs a round on demand, regardless of the flag.
- **Health**: `untraced_commits_fixed`, `untraced_commits_skipped`,
  `untraced_cursor_reseeds`, `untraced_scan_errors`, `known_repo_families` in
  `status.daemon`, `git-ai bg status`, and the heartbeat.

## Repositories the fixup ignores

AI agents create scratch repositories under the OS temp directory for their own
work. The fixup leaves those alone: it never remembers, scans, persists or
backfills a family whose canonical common dir is under a temp root
(`$TMPDIR`/`TEMP`/`TMP`, `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, macOS `/var/folders`, Windows
`%TEMP%`) or matches an `untraced_fixup_ignored_paths` glob from the config.
Rows for such families are forgotten on the next maintenance round.

This is scoped to the fixup and its store (`src/daemon/untraced_fixup_ignore.rs`,
consulted only by the fixup scheduler). It is not a global repository exclusion:
traced commands and checkpoints in a temp repository keep their normal
behaviour. The temp-root part is gated by the `untraced_fixup_ignore_temp_repos`
feature flag (on by default; the test harness turns it off because every test
repository lives under the temp dir); configured globs always apply.

The check is a component-wise prefix comparison per root and a glob match per
pattern on strings computed once at startup, placed at the top of the per-family
loop a tick already runs, before the stat and any store write. An ignored
family therefore costs less than it did, and a non-ignored one costs a handful
of byte comparisons more.

## Known limitations

- Detached-HEAD commits are never fixed up.
- libgit2 callers may write arbitrary or empty reflog messages; those are skipped.
- Rewrites made untraced (amend, rebase, cherry-pick, revert) are never
  migrated; the replacement commits get no notes.
- A pass runs later than the commit, so time-window recovery solvers (bash
  mtime, session events) only apply while the committed files are unchanged
  in the worktree; commit-metadata and working-log evidence always apply.
- Checkpoints that reach the daemon between an untraced commit and its fixup
  pass are keyed by the new HEAD without the `INITIAL` attribution the pass
  writes later; for a file already checkpointed in that window, leftover
  uncommitted AI lines are not carried into the next commit. The traced path
  is not exposed to this because its post-commit runs before later
  checkpoints; the untraced window is `interval + min age` (about 15 s).
- Corroboration reads each branch reflog's tail (1 MiB) and falls back to the
  whole file once per pass, within a 16 MiB budget of branch reflog bytes per
  pass; a candidate whose corroboration would exceed the budget is skipped,
  never claimed. A pass walks at most 4 MiB of `HEAD` reflog before handing
  the rest to a follow-up pass.

## Test obligations

`tests/integration/untraced_commit_fixup.rs` covers: attribution from a
delivered working log and from recovery alone; daemon-off commit after
restart; untraced amend, rebase (daemon on and off), pull, and detached commit
skipped; no backfill on first sighting; exactly-once (one note, one metric,
traced commits never reclaimed); linked worktrees; the periodic and startup
scans; the feature flag. Unit tests live in `src/daemon/ref_cursor.rs`
(claim), `src/daemon/family_actor.rs`, `src/daemon/repo_family_store.rs`, and
`src/git/repo_state.rs` (worktree enumeration).
